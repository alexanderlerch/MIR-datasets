In an effort to extend the amount of teaching resources on the website, I am happy to release a series of <a href="http://www.audiocontentanalysis.org/teaching/">video lectures for my class on Audio Content Analysis</a>. The new structure closely resembles the structure of the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?bknumber=6266785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">textbook</a> and the modules try to split each chapter into digestible chunks.

The videos are currently streamed from a <a href="https://mediaspace.gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Tech service</a> and allow you to see the slides and the video side by side in one player.

All content, including the slides (pdf), the latex source code for the slides, the Matlab code to produce the plots, and the audio examples, are available on <a href="https://github.com/alexanderlerch/ACA-Slides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>. Links to the relevant content can be found on the individual video module page.

Furthermore, I launched a forum in which you can ask (and answer) questions on the class content. This is just a test and we will see how well this plugin works.

I look forward to your feedback - let me know what you think.
