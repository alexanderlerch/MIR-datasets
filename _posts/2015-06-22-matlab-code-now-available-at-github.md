All matlab code is now moved from my private repository to a public <a href="https://github.com/alexanderlerch/ACA-Code" target="_blank">github repository</a>. It can now be downloaded directly from the repository instead of the manually assembled zip archive I offered before.

This allows for easier updates and has a publicly available version history. Furthermore, this allows to directly embed the code into the page (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.audiocontentanalysis.org/code/audio-features/computefeature/">the feature computation function</a>. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I made any mistakes updating the web site.
