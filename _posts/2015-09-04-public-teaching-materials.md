As the Fall 2015 semester proceeds, I will make as many teaching materials as possible available online. This most noticeably includes all the <a href="http://www.audiocontentanalysis.org/teaching/">slides</a>, along with <a href="https://github.com/alexanderlerch/ACA-Slides" target="_blank">source code</a> for both the LaTeX slides as well as the Matlab code for generating the figures. The previous <a href="http://www.audiocontentanalysis.org/teaching/exercises/" target="_blank">list of exercises and quiz questions</a> will also be expanded from time to time.

I hope that, in combination with the original Matlab source code now being available <a href="https://github.com/alexanderlerch/ACA-Code" target="_blank">in a repository</a> as well, these materials will provide both teachers and students with helpful resources for their classes in Music Information Retrieval and Audio Analysis.
