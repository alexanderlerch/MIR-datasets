This fall we will launch a <a href="http://www.music.gatech.edu/bsmt">Bachelor of Science in Music Technology at Georgia Tech</a>. Given our current <a href="http://www.music.gatech.edu/graduate">MS and PhD programs</a>, the BS now allows us to offer Music Technology classes at all levels. The undergraduate program will be, just like the graduate programs, quite unique in its curriculum and focus; with concentrations/minors in subjects such as ECE or ME, it is clear that this is not another audio engineering degree. Core classes such as <em>Fundamentals of Musicianship</em> and <em>Introduction to Audio Technology</em> as well as many project-based classes will allow our graduates to have a rare and sought-after combination of skills and knowledge. We expect our bachelors to work at the same companies our graduate students work, including Dolby, Google, Apple, Gracenote, Spotify, Pandora, ableton, Moog, and many more.
